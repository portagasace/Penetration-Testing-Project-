# Penetration-Testing-Project-
In this project my aim was to demonstrate Cross site request forgery on a sample website using POST method.
Cross-site request forgery (also known as CSRF) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce users to perform actions that they do not intend to perform. It allows an attacker to partly circumvent the same origin policy, which is designed to prevent different websites from interfering with each other.
Most interesting CSRF vulnerabilities arise due to mistakes made in the validation of CSRF tokens.
